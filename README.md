# SSR - Server Side Render

In this repository you'll find my personal practice for the Server Side Render course by [Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/ssr/). The project we worked on during the course is in the **PlatziVideo-feature-router-redux** directory. 

The main goal of the course was to understand how a server side render application works. For this, we worked on a previously created [React.js](https://es.reactjs.org/) app. The practice realized during the course pointed to render the React.js app from the server side. The code you'll find here is the result of the changes applied during the course so we could do so. If you want to relate to the original code go to https://github.com/platzi/PlatziVideo to start working from scratch...
